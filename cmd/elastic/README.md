### ELASTIC

The Elastic command is used to dump data from the elastsic search cluster into Excel format. It can be easily configured for a use case by specifying the data fields that are printed to the CSV. 

This was originally written to perform latency analysis of transactions across a large set of ES servers.

The cluster server list is hardcoded into the source code and is used to specify which ES databses to query from.
